3.0.0 (April 21, 2017)
-----------------------
 - Rewritten in Python, MEL is no longer supported
 - Easily favor poses on different body parts in different ways using multiple sets
 - Organize sets in collapsable custom groups (see screen shot)
 - Control how sets and groups affect the ticks on the timeline
 - Create an overshoot pose by enabling overshoot mode
 - Adjust the UI to use sliders, buttons, or both
 - Affect only the channels highlighted in the channel box for selected objects
 - Easily work with character sets, either by using a single custom slider, or by importing character set info into tweenMachine
 - Use Maya’s “special” tick color to identify keys made with tweenMachine
